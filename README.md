### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My daytime profession is a Mobile Software Engineer, however, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies that are new to me!

Feel free to poke around in my GitHub. I mainly use this space as a playground to cement my own knowledge and understanding, as well as creating rapid prototypes to investigate ideas.

My preferred language is JavaScript/Kotlin, which I use daily for work, but again, always happy to dip my toes into the unknown, as I enjoy learning new things and like to stay curious!
