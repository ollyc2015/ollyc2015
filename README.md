### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Android Developer that enjoys experimenting with different technologies.

Feel free to poke around in my GitHub. I mainly use this space as a playground to cement my own knowledge and understanding, as well as creating rapid prototypes to investigate ideas.

My preferred language is Kotlin, which I use daily for work, but again, always happy to dip my toes into the unknown, as I enjoy learning new things and like to stay curious!
